# AJAX_and_President

This is a project that retrieving the JSON resources about the presidents information in the US and then , parse the return, 
and filter and display data as a table. 
The JSON resources are come from my professor's website, http://schwartzcomputer.com. Welcome to give me any advise or make some change.
